# Hey you! Yeah, you!

You're viewing this on docs.rs. Look at you!

Anyway, because of the nature of the OpenSHMEM ecosystem,
the documentation here is probably meaningless for you.

When you build a program using openshmem-sys (or openshmem-rs),
what's shown here will probably change based
on your implementation. If you REALLY want to see what 
your implementation provides, try `cargo doc --open` on a project
that depends on openshmem-[sys, rs], or this repo.
